Feel free to structure your project's post however you like. A good post should include
- A succinct introduction about your project
- A section that thoroughly documents your work - design, technical, and appropriate process work
- Any media (photos, videos) that is suitably polished to represent your finished work publicly on the website
- A link to your Github repo (i.e. a folder you store your work, not the main HIRo home folder)
- (Optional) Future steps
- (Optional) Installation guide: imagine an Olin student with a skillset similar to yours should be able to reproduce your work
- (Optional) A credit section if you use third-party libraries/tools
